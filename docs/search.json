Our analysis indicates\r\n            that transitioning to a fiscal system where municipalities\r\n            receive a substantially higher share of personal income tax\r\n            (PIT) results in increased PIT payments even controlling for\r\n            the night-light index, a well known economic activity proxy.\r\n            The night-light index, at the same time, was positively\r\n            affected by the decentralisation as well. We attribute these\r\n            processes to several factors. Firstly, the new fiscal system\r\n            stimulates economic growth, leading to an expansion of the\r\n            tax base as local governments are incentivised to foster\r\n            local economic development. Secondly, tax compliance\r\n            increases within the new framework, aligning with findings\r\n            from experimental literature on contributions to local\r\n            versus global public goods. Taxpayers’ willingness to pay\r\n            taxes increases when taxes are allocated to municipal\r\n            budgets, making public good provisions more tangible to\r\n            taxpayers.\r\n            When Mediation Matters: Cooperation in\r\n            Experimental Militarisation Games | with Ryan\r\n            Swan\r\n            Abstract\r\n            \r\n            This paper studies how mediation affects people’s decisions\r\n            towards cooperation in militarisation games. Specifically,\r\n            we examine how the presence and nature of a mediator\r\n            influence the likelihood of cooperative outcomes. To do\r\n            this, we run the experiment with three different settings.\r\n            We compare the theoretical predictions derived from\r\n            game-theoretic equilibrium strategies with the actual\r\n            behaviour observed in our experiments. Our findings reveal\r\n            that the presence of a mediator—even one who does not alter\r\n            the equilibrium structure of the game—significantly\r\n            increases the rate of cooperation among participants. At the\r\n            same time, we do not find strong evidence that participants\r\n            have a clear preference between an uninformed mediator and\r\n            one who is informed about their private types.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Teaching\r\n            2025 Current Topics in Economics (Bachelor) | University\r\n            of Bonn\r\n            2024-2025 Research Module (Group Mentor, Master) |\r\n            University of Bonn\r\n            2017-2018 Econometrics (Teaching Assistant, Master) |\r\n            Kyiv School of Economics\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Policy Research (selected)\r\n            \r\n            Trade\r\n            Potential Assessment of Value Chains in The Eastern\r\n            Ukrainian Economy | with Pavlo Iavorskyi | Kyiv School\r\n            of Economics, 2020\r\n            Ukraine’s\r\n            integration into the EU’s digital single market: Potential\r\n            Economic Benefits | with Pavlo Iavorskyi, Svitlana\r\n            Taran, Oleksandr Shepotylo | Kyiv School of Economics,\r\n            2020\r\n            How\r\n            to make road maintenance more cost-efficient?
