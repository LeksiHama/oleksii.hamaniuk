 **Go local - improve tax compliance?** | with Benedikt Herrmann, Felix Rösel | Draft available upon request  

<details>
  <summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>
  This study explores the impact of fiscal structure on the tax compliance and local economic growth, focusing on the unique context in Ukraine between 2016 and 2020, during which two distinct fiscal systems operated simultaneously due to the decentralisation reform. Our analysis indicates that transitioning to a fiscal system where municipalities receive a substantially higher share of personal income tax (PIT) results in increased PIT payments even controlling for the night-light index, a well known economic activity proxy. The night-light index, at the same time, was positively affected by the decentralisation as well. We attribute these processes to several factors. Firstly, the new fiscal system stimulates economic growth, leading to an expansion of the tax base as local governments are incentivised to foster local economic development. Secondly, tax compliance increases within the new framework, aligning with findings from experimental literature on contributions to local versus global public goods. Taxpayers' willingness to pay taxes increases when taxes are allocated to municipal budgets, making public good provisions more tangible to taxpayers.

**When Mediation Matters: Cooperation in Experimental Militarisation Games** | with Ryan Swan  

<details>
  <summary><em>Abstract</em></summary>
This paper studies how mediation affects people’s decisions towards cooperation in militarisation games. Specifically, we examine how the presence and nature of a mediator influence the likelihood of cooperative outcomes. To do this, we run the experiment with three different settings. We compare the theoretical predictions derived from game-theoretic equilibrium strategies with the actual behaviour observed in our experiments. Our findings reveal that the presence of a mediator—even one who does not alter the equilibrium structure of the game—significantly increases the rate of cooperation among participants.  At the same time, we do not find strong evidence that participants have a clear preference between an uninformed mediator and one who is informed about their private types.
